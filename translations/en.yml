      value: "Solve tickets faster by extending the collaborative power of Zendesk Support to Highrise.  You can easily keep track of all of your contacts. Every individual has their own unique page where you and your team can collaborate and share notes, add tasks, and most importantly, close deals.  Including Highrise content on Zendesk Support ticket pages enables your support agents to see that contactâ€™s Highrise information in-context, including Twitter handle, phone number, and more.


Agents can add a profile or notes to contacts in Highrise from within Zendesk Support, giving your sales and marketing teams complete visibility into customer service cases.
